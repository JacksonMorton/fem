             Release 1.0 of the Livermore Software Data Archival
                     routines & documentation


Here is a brief description of the contents:

  license.pdf     - the legal stuff.  You should read this.
  lsda.c          - primary source file
  lsdaf2c.c       - some Fortran interface code
  lsdaf.F         - more Fortran interfact code
  lsdatable.c     - data table internals
  lsdatypes.c     - data type internals
  btree.c         - some generally useful balanced binary tree routines
  trans.c         - data translation functions
  lsda.h          - header file (you'll need this for your own building)
  lsda_internal.h - another header file (LSDA internal use only)
  btree.h         - btree interface header file
  lsda.inc        - Fortran style include file (for your applications)

  test/iotst1.c   - sample test program
  test/iotst2.c   - sample test program
  test/iotst3.F   - sample test program
  test/ioq.c      - generally useful for interactive investigation of
                    LSDA files.
  test/l2a.c      - sample application that translates the LS-DYNA output
                    database into the equivalent old style ASCII output
  test/binascii.txt
                  - a detailed description of the LS-DYNA database
  doc/file_format - a description of the internals of an LSDA file
  doc/lsda.html   - a spotty HTML man page for the routines themselves.

There is a makefile in the "test" subdirectory, which can be used to build
the sample programs and library on several systems.  run "make" without
any options for more details.
