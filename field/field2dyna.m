% INPUT:
% NodeName (string) - file name to read nodes from (e.g., nodes.dyn); needs to
% be a comma-delimited file with header/footer lines that
% start with *
% alpha - 0.5, 1.0, etc. (dB/cm/MHz)
% Fnum - F/# (e.g. 1.3)
% focus - [x y z] (m) "Field" coordinates
% Frequency - excitation frequency (MHz)
% Transducer (string) - 'vf105','vf73'
% Impulse (string) - 'gaussian','exp'
%
% OUTPUT:
% dyna_ispta*.mat file is saved to CWD
%
% Example:
% field2dyna('nodes.dyn',0.5,1.3,[0 0 0.02],7.2,'vf105','gaussian');
