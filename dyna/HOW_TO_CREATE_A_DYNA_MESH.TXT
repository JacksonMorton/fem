How to create a rectangular solid mesh using ls-prepost

Last Updated: 2010-12-30 (Mark)

(1) Copy and edit /krnlab/mlp6/fem/dyn/MeshGen.cfile.  You just need to edit
the first line - the syntax specified the min x,y,z    coordinates in the model
and the max coordinates (x,y,z) followed by the node density along each
dimension.  The example one is     x:0 -> -1.5 cm, y:0 -> 1.5 cm, and z: -0.1
-> -8.1 cm.  Make sure that you keep this relative convention the same (i.e., a
"negative" right-hand rule), and don't start z right at 0.                                                                          
                                                                                                                                    
(2) Run this script through ls-prepost on the command line:                                                                         
ls-prepost2 -nographics c=MeshGen.cfile.                                                                                            

Note - you can also use lspp3 (the next generation of ls-prepost), but there
have been some issues w/ the nographics commandline flag.  You can either run
it with the GUI popping up, or see the wiki for a work-around for this bug.
                                                                                                                                    
(3) Run /krnlab/mlp6/fem/dyna/parseElemsNode.py 
                                                                                                                                    
This will create node.dyn and elems.dyn, all of which are used
either in include statements in the dyna deck or in the field code.                                                                                                                     
Note - this replaced the now depreciated parseElemsNodes.pl script that did
things a bit differently and was less flexible.  See the commandline help for
parseElemsNode.py for detailed differences (or read comments in the header of
the script).
                                                                                                                                    
(4) Create the correct boundary conditions using:                                                                                   
/krnlab/mlp6/fem/bc.py                                                               
                                                                                                                                    
Note - this also replaces the depreciated BoundCond.pl.  This is much more
flexible, being able to handle different types of symmetry conditions, etc.
See the commandline help and/or script header comments for more details.
