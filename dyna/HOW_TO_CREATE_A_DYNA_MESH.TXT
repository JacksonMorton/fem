(1) Copy and edit /krnlab/mlp6/fem/dyn/MeshGen.cfile.  You just need to edit
the first line - the syntax specified the min x,y,z    coordinates in the model
and the max coordinates (x,y,z) followed by the node density along each
dimension.  The example one is     x:0 -> -1.5 cm, y:0 -> 1.5 cm, and z: -0.1
-> -8.1 cm.  Make sure that you keep this relative convention the same (i.e., a
"negative" right-hand rule), and don't start z right at 0.                                                                          
                                                                                                                                    
(2) Run this script through ls-prepost on the command line:                                                                         
ls-prepost2 -nographics c=MeshGen.cfile.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                    
(3) Run /krnlab/mlp6/fem/dyna/parseElemsNode.pl < mesh.dyn                                                                          
                                                                                                                                    
This will create node.dyn, nodes.asc, and elems.dyn, all of which are used
either in include statements in the dyna deck or in the field code.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                    
(4) Create the correct boundary conditions using:                                                                                   
/krnlab/mlp6/fem/BoundCondQsym.pl (assuming you do quarter symmetry)                                                                
                                                                                                                                    
The bc.dyn file that is written needs to be included in the dyn file.
