% function [SortedNodeIDs,ele,lat,axial]=SortNodeIDs(nodes_file);
% SortNodeIDs - spatially sort the Node IDs
%
% INPUTS: nodes_file (string) - file containing the node IDs
% and coordinates; comma delimited
%
% OUTPUTS: 
%   SortedNodeIDs (int) - 3D matrix of spatially sorted node IDs
%   ele (floats) - unique elevation axis
%   lat (floats) - unique lateral axis
%   axial (floats) - unique axial axis

% Updated to round out the tolerance errors that HyperMesh can

% Updated the comments to reflect what is actually going on.

% changed nodes.asc -> nodes.dyn (i.e., handle header/footer starting with '*'
